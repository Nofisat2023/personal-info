        In the next two years, i aim to establish myself as a proficient web
        developer, contriuting to variou projects and expanding my skill set. my
        primary focus will be on learning React and TypeScript, two cutting-edge
        technologies driving innovation in the web development landscape.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <p>To achieve this, i plan to:</p>
        <li>
          Contribute to at least three open-source projects on GitHub,
          collaborating with other developers and learning from their
          expriences.
        </li>
        <li>
          build a personal website using React and TypeScript, showcasing my
          skills and creativity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Paticipate in online communities, such as Reddit's r/ webdev, to stay
          updated on industry trends and best practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Complete online courses or certifications to increase my understanding
          of web development and related technologies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Through these endeavors, i seek to not only enhance my technical skills
        but also develop a strong portfolio, demostrating my capabilities to
        potential employers orr clients. While i don't currently have
        educational aspiration, i remain open to oppoutunities that may arise,
        such as pursuing a degree or advanced certificationin the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        By dedicating myself to these goals, i am confident that i will become a
        skilled web developer, equipped to tackle challengeing projects and
        contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
